On the way to the store, I saw a car with the license plate 8 JZ-302.
There were 23 people on the bus,
but only 12 seats. I had to pay 4 dollars and 50

I have a collection of 50 seashells from my travels and 8 rocks that I found on the beach.

The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is 93000000 miles, or about 149000000 kilometers.
A petabyte is equal to 1000000000 gigabytes, and the total amount of data generated worldwide every day
is estimated to be about 1000000000 bytes. The largest prime number ever discovered has 1000000000 digits
and was found in 2018. It would take about 1000000000 seconds, or approximately 38 years,
to count to 1000000000 out loud at a rate of 1 number per second.
